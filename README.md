## Prebuilt binaries

Check out the directory `bin`

## Notes

The crypto is experimental, however don't be stupid. echo'ing "password", or "abc" or "hello world" or anything common into anything2ed25519 - **don't ever** use that anywhere, since people can guess your private key.. This is like a bitcoin "mnemonic code" and should have at least 24 words..
