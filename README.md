# Make a SSH Ed25519 private/public keypair of **anything** you can pipe into a UNIX pipe

```
Usage of anything2ed25519:
  -force
    	When true, you ignore the author's recommendation about seed size
    	(should be at minimum 32 chars, more is better) and continues with your stupidness
  -privfile string
    	Filename to write private key to (default "id_ed25519")
  -privtoerr
    	When true, the tool prints private key to stderr and public to stdout
  -pubfile string
    	Filename to write public key to (default "id_ed25519.pub")
  -write
    	When true it writes the private and public keys to file (default true)

The command is intended to work with pipes.
Example:
	echo 'never lose a key again 81S1r8zpVuFjpJ5odwDTmplp4HZ5JskQ' | anything2ed25519
```

## Prebuilt binaries

Check out the directory `bin`

## Notes

The crypto is experimental, however don't be stupid. echo'ing "password", or "abc" or "hello world" or anything common into anything2ed25519 - **don't ever** use that anywhere, since people can guess your private key.. This is like a bitcoin "mnemonic code" and should have at least 24 words..
